# Trandformer-and-RCNN-on-Badminton-Stroke-Direction-Identification
This repository stores the code that aims to advance sport science in badminton, providing a systematic approach to generate stroke & player movement sequences automatically from game videos using modern AI techniques. A deep evaluation on BWF records can then be conducted.
CNN and Keypoint R-CNN models are applied to extract frames, and collect court and player information. Moreover, a Transformer model to translate player joint sequences to shuttlecock direction sequences.
